Step 1: Checking Data
    Shape
    Columns
    Sample (Head)
    Describe
    Check Null Values
    Check Incorrect Values
    Check Inconsistencies

Step 2: Cleaning Data
    Remove Duplicates if any
    Handle Missing Values
    Handle incorrect values
    Handle inconsitencies
    Standardize Column Names
    Normalize Data (Remove whitespaces, punctuations, make lowercases etc.)
    Standardize dates (Convert posted days to date time)
    Trim Whitespaces
    Clean Location Field for categorization
    Validate and fix broken links
    Create a clean copy to do EDA on the cleaned data


Step 3: EDA

    Top Job Categories by count
    [Category].value_count().plot(barh)
    How many jobs are listed in each category
    Distribution of Jobs by each category 
    Count jobs in each category
    Which category is in most demand
    
    Top Companies per category
    For each category, which companies hire the most
    Grouped Bar Chart, top 5 per category
    
    Most frequent companies
    [Company]value_counts().head(10)
    Which companies hire the most
    
    Jobs over time
    [Date]value_counts().sort_index().plot(bar)
    Identify hiring spikes. Which time might a job be posted more, start or end of a month or week. Line or bar chart. 
    
    Posting Frequency per category
    Number of jobs posted per day in each category
    Useful to understand how dynamic or stable the hiring is in different roles
    
    Top Job titles per category
    Within each category, which are most common
    
    Most Common Job Titles
    Normalize tirles *convert to lower cases, remoce punctuations*
    Group and count similar titles
    Use frequency plot or word cloud
    
    Remote locations breakdown
    [Location]value_counts().head(10)
    Create a piechart on location availability 
    Which countries are most mentioned 
    
    Posting activity by Category
    Heatmap of Category vs posted date
    

Step 4: Feature Engineering:

    Add Remote Type from location
    Global, Americas Only, etc.
    
    Posted on which day
    Eg: Monday is popular for posting 
    
    Job Level if available
    Senior, Lead, Principal = Senior
    Manager, Director, Head = Managerial
    Junior, Intern, Entry = Junior
    Otherwise = Midlevel


Step 5: Insights


    Example Insights:
    _category_ has the most remote friendly jobs globally
    _category_ is more likely to be us based
    _catgegory_ roles are most frequently posted
    _category_ saw a spike in early May
    Do _joblevel_ appear more in Global or US
    Which day sees the most postings
